        <p>About four years ago I started the writing of my PhD thesis using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> template provided by the university. 
But that template did not look right - sometimes I get obsessed with how things look like. 
Two major issues were that: a) the official visual style of the university was not present in the LaTeX template; and b) the typesetting for mathematics and some other environments were quite limited and basic.
Consequently, I spent same amount of time on styling as I spent on writing the actual thesis :D.</p>

        <p>Over the years I have been setting up many weblogs and CMS sites for people. When WordPress came out and everyone was migrating to it, I also created a blog for myself. I did so with Drupal and few other platforms, but none of those weblogs survived beyond couple of posts. You see the pattern here; the focus has been on technology rather than the content. Some days ago, I got interested in Jekyll and decided to give it a go after many years of no web development. Meanwhile I started writing some notes about typesetting in TeX for a colleague, which looked like a good material for publishing. Seeing an Ad from GoDaddy for 2$ domain registration completed the picture. I registered “randomdoctor.com” and started yet another blog. Hopefully this one will last for a while :) I wrote a short <a href="/about">biography of myself</a> that you may read, or continue with the following notes about setting up the blog.</p>
