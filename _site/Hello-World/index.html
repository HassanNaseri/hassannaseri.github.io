  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Over the years I have been setting up many weblogs and CMS sites for people. When WordPress came out and everyone was migrating to it, I also created a blog for myself. I did so with Drupal and few other platforms, but none of those weblogs survived beyond couple of posts. You see the dilemma here; the focus has been on technology rather than the content. Some days ago, I got interested in Jekyll and decided to give it a go after many years of no web development. Meanwhile I started writing some notes about typesetting in TeX for a colleague, which looked like a good material for publishing. Seeing an Ad from GoDaddy for 2$ domain registration completed the picture. I registered “randomdoctor.com” and started yet another blog. Hopefully this one will last for a while :) I wrote a short <a href="/about">biography of myself</a> that you may read, or continue with the following notes about setting up the blog.</p>

<h2 id="blog--setup">Blog  Setup</h2>
<p>I used GitHub to host the blog. GitHub Pages is magical in its automatic building of Jekyll websites. I followed the instructions given <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">in this well written blog post</a>. Afterwards, I installed Jekyll on my MacBook, and started experimenting with it locally. All in all, I liked this exercise very much :). Here are some notes regarding my experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">MarkDown</a> language for technology/science blogging is awesome. I enjoy its easy and nice typesetting for text, code, and math formulas.</li>
  <li>Jekyll is many times better than WordPress if you want a simple weblog. It is minimal; The workflow is sophisticated; and you have great control over everything.</li>
  <li>Despite being quick to setup, it is highly customizable and extendible through plugins.</li>
  <li>DNS setup was not very smooth, but I finally managed to read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">this guide</a> and configure the apex for “randomdoctor.com”.</li>
  <li>Jekyll works like a charm when installed on local machine. You run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>; and afterwards every change that you make instantly appears in the browser. This is very helpful while styling a website.</li>
  <li>I did some styling, including changing colors, fonts, and a bit of the template. I summarize some steps that may work as examples for the next amateur :)
    <ul>
      <li>I started with the default theme <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">midnight</code>. The gem package for this is named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-theme-midnight</code>, which can be modified in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Gemfile</code>.</li>
      <li>Configuration begins with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_config.yml</code> file. Other than usual setup, I added few plugins under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plugins:</code> section, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-email-protect</code>. This requires adding the gem package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-email-protect</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Gemfile</code>.</li>
      <li>You define the colors such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$bgcolor</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_sass/_variables.scss</code> and apply them in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/style.scss</code>.</li>
      <li>I used Adobe Fonts (Typekit) to create font-face css file for serif font Adobe Caslon. I also downloaded the sans-serif font Linux Biolinum into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/fonts</code> folder and put its font-face css file there. These two css files are imported in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_sass/_variables.scss</code>, and variables such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$body-font</code> are defined there. You may indeed modify the use of those font variables in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/style.scss</code> if needed.</li>
      <li>I added date tag for posts in the index page. Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/index.html</code> and add 
   {{ post.date | date: “%B %e, %Y” }}<br />
  inside a new div block <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div class="date"&gt;</code> under the title line. I also moved the same tag in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts/post.html</code> from bottom to the top.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
