I"y<p>Some years ago I had to write my PhD thesis using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> template provided by the univeristy. Sometimes I become very obsessive with how things look like, and that template did not look right. Consequently, I spent same amount of time on styling as I spent on writing the actual thesis :D, hoping that it may benefit others as well. Two major problems of the provided template were: a) the official visual style of the university was not present in the LaTeX template; and b) the typesetting for mathematics and some other environments were quite limitted and basic.</p>
