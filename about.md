As a kid, I got memerized by computers, even though they had no color monitor, speakers, mouse, graphical user interface, CD driver, and definitely no internet. Just staring at a black-and-white text screen of MS DOS, typing commands and getting the computer reply was sufficinet to take my whole summers. I learned some sort of BASIC programming language and stotred those precious programms on floppy disks to make sure they become permanent, since my Taiwanese IBM PC replica did not have a hard drive. Long story short, many yeras later, I started my career in ICT sector as a web developer. From there, I moved between different branches of electronics, telecommunication, and computing industry. Today, I work as a technology architect for artificial intelligence and quantum computing solutions, and write Pythin code whenever coding is needed. However, this weblog is not all about coding and technology, but just random notes. So, I am not sure why did I start introducing myslef with this nerdy tech story!

I live in northern Europe and enjoy camping and travelling. So, there will be some posts about these stuff. I also read a lot of random stuff, and talk to myslef about them! Hopefully, this blog will eliminate some of those talks :D


### I am a real Doctor!

I studied elctronics engineering in my bechelor, specialzed in control systems, then continued with information technology and telecommunications, and finally received a PhD in signal processing technology. I include the cover of my doctoral thesis here to proove that I am a real doctor of some kind.

This cover page is also the reason why this weblog ended up in fuchsia colors.
