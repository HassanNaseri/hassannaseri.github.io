* Don't become too smart in your daily life
Being very smart in everyday matters can easily separate you from folk. This is especially important if you become obsessed with making life easier and more convinient for yourself. As an example, I used to work at the end of long building in 4th floor. Walking from main door to my room was giving me a chance to see few of my colleagues and running activities everyday. However, I was annoyed with the number of doors in the corridors that I should open and go trough. Gradually I started counting doors in each possible path, and I found an specific route with minimum number of doors. Going from first staircase up to the 3rd floor following till the last staircase and going up to the 4th floor. I was follwoing this path for a while, untill I realized that for a while I am not seeing anyone. Meanwhile I bought a car and found an small parking place at other and of building, coming from backdoor it a lot easier and shorter to reach my room. After sometime I realized that I am not seeing any of my colleagues and I don't know about any activity in  the building. I switched back to the old style of random path from main door!

Some random political notes about populism. Few years ago, there was a fear among many that populsim is rising to power around the globe. This is porbably first kicked off by Trump becoming US president and then a series of elections across Europe and UK, and events such a Brexist. It came as a question to me why? 

I always took Trump as a joke, and never believed that he can get elected. But what happens, how the intellectual atmosphere of Obama administration shifted to the absurd populsim of Trump? 

Obama played it too smart! People did not understand Obama. If you read Emanuel Kant as your innaguration speech, you shoudl not expect public acceptance.
