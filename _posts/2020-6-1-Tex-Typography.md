Some years ago I had to write my PhD thesis using a LaTeX template provided by the univeristy. It was a half-ready tempalte; and I was very obsessive. Consequently, I spent same amount of time on styling as I spent on writing the actual content :D. There were two issues with the existing style: a) the official graphical style of the university was not present in the LaTeX template; and b) typesetting for mathematics and some other environments were quite limitted and basic.

Let's fist discuss the second issue. 

Coming back to the first issue of overal graphical style, the main problem was the absence of official fonts in the LaTeX template. There is no easy way to use Sentinel and Nimbus Sans as text and math fonts in LaTeX. To adress this issue, I eventually switched from LaTeX to XeLaTeX to use OpenType fonts freely for text and math. This document, however, is about LaTeX or applicable to both LaTeX and XeLaTeX unless exlicitly specified. A separate discussion about font setting in XeTeX is included as well. 

## Matching Fonts 
TeX has two main fornt families used for text 'Serif' and 'Non Serif'. There is also 'Type Writer' family. For math environment, there is normal math font and 'Match Caligraphy' font. Other font shapes might be also used in math, including 'Math Blackboard' and 'Math Script'. Ideally all these font families should have matching shapes. Matching menas that they have relatively simillar size, weight and shape, such that they look to complement each other.  

If a basic TeX template is used the default font/typeface is Computer Modern. This has matching fonts for all font families.

### Times Font

### Bolds, Italics

### Upright Greek

### XeTeX

## Spacing, Kerning, Typesetting

Always use microtype
