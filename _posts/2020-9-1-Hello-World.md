Over the years I have been setting up many weblogs and CMS sites for people. When WordPress came out and everyone was migrating there, I also created a blog for myself. I did so with Drupal and few other platforms, but none of those weblogs survived beyond couple of posts. You see the matter here, the focus has been on technology rather than the content. Some days ago, I got interested in Jekyll and decided to give it a go after many years of no web development. Meanwhile I started writing some notes about typesetting in TeX for a colleague, which looked like a good material for publishing. Seeing an Ad from GoDaddy for 2$ domain registration completed the picture. I registered "randomdoctor.com" and started yet another blog. Hopefully this one will last for a while :) I wrote a short [biography of myself](/about) that you may read, or continue with the following notes about setting up the blog.


## Blog  Setup
I used GitHub to host the blog. GitHub Pages is magical in its automatic building of Jekyll websites. I followed the instructions given [in this well written blog post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Afterwards, I installed Jekyll on my MacBook, and started experimenting with it locally. All in all, I liked this exercise very much :). Here are some notes regarding my experience.

- The use of MarkDown language for technology/science blogging is awesome. I enjoy its easy and nice typesetting for text, code, and math formulas. 
- Jekyll is many times better than WordPress if you want a simple weblog. It is minimal; The workflow is sophisticated; and you have great control over everything.
- Despite being quick to setup, it is highly customizable and extendible through plugins. 
- DNS setup was not very smooth, but I finally managed to read [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) and configure the apex for "randomdoctor.com".
- Jekyll works like a magic when installed on local machine. You run `bundle exec jekyll serve`; and afterwards every change that you make instantly appears in the browser. This is very helpful while styling a website.
