Over the years I have been setting up many weblogs and CMSs for differet people. For example, I remember when WordPress came out and everyone was asking to migrate. In this process, I created few blogs for myslef as well. But none of them survived beyong couple of posts. Few days ago, I got interested in Jekyll and decided to give it a go after many years of no web development. Meanwhile I started writing some notes about typesetting in TeX for a colleague, that sounded like a good subject for a blog post. I also encountered an Ad from GoDaddy for 2$ domain registration. It also sounded fun to try a random domain name by sparing $2. I went on and registered "randomdoctopr.com". So everything came together to start yet another blog. Hopefully this will last for a while :)


## Blog  Setup
I used GitHub to host the blog and automatically build Jekyll webiste. This is nicely done with GitHub Pages. I followed the instructions given [in this well written blog post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Afterwards, I installed Jekyll on my MacBook, and started experimenting with it on local machine. All in all, I liked this exercise very much :). Here are some note regarding my experince.

- The use of MarkDown language for tech. blogging is awesome. I like the easy and nice typesetting for text, code, and math formulas. 
- Jekyll is many times better than WordPress if you want a simple weblog. It is minimal; The workflow is sophisticated; and you have great control over everything.
- DNS setup was not very smooth. I used CNAME, but could not set it for the root of the domain. So, started with subdomain of blog.randomdoctor.com until I find time to sort out the rest.
- Jekyll is a miracle when used on local machine. After you execute `bundle exec jekyll serve`, then any change that you make to your files  almost instantly shows up in your website (jekyll automatically updates the site). This is specially important when styling your website.
