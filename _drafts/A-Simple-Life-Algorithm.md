I have been watching the midnight sun over the horizon on the shore of Barents sea, i.e., at the northern edge of the continet of Europe. It was a cold sun in a dark orange sky, with mountains all around, a white beach, and crystal clear waters with no end in front. I was alone on the last rock of a small rudimentry rock pier and  thinking that this should be one of those moments that people would call magical. I Grabbed my phone a took a short video starting from my shoes, going through the crystal clear water and ending in the sun and mountains. Then put the phone back in pocket. It slipped, fall on a rock, and quickly slided into the deep cold water. I could not see the phone anymore some three meters under water behind some rocks. Took my cloth off at chilling midnight, put the head under freezing water, but no chance without goggles. The phone was gone, and the magical moment :D 

Consequently, I started thinkking about the meaning of life. I think you get a bit phillosophical when you loose something. Seems to be natural defence mechansim to cover up the mistake or modereate the pain. The optimist would go all the way to label it as exprience, and the nihillist would just question the whole meaning of life and belonging. I happned to calm myslef  in the past by calling it an opportunity to become less dependent on materials and live more freely. But this times, I ended up in a deeper phillosophy of why do we exist. It was either due to the earlier magical end of the world experience or because of carrying Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" with me during this trip, which wild camping combined with all the apps on the smartphone did not give me a cahnce to read yet, more on this book later on. 

On my way back to the tent, and during the rest of night, I started simplifying the life to its barebones. For my inner engineer, the question was that, what is the simplest most minimal model for life on erath that can still carry some basic principles. This evolved to the question of, who can we design the simplest mechansim that is capable of evolving in generations.


You are aware of how life evoilves and propagates on earth, you have also know about the genetic algorithm, which is inspired by natural selection to solve certain compuytation proble. This post is aboiut neither of them, but my own reflections to understand life on earth in its most basic form.




## Why two sexes


Simple algo:

1- Start with a random population
2- Test for survival -> Eliminate
3- Reproduce


- we have two copies of gene, when reporiducing the same parts remain same and the non-similar parts ar takken from either part. 


## The Origin of Species
After loosing the phone, I found time to read this miraculous book that I have been carrying for a while. This is is the biggest achievemnegt of all phillosophy.
