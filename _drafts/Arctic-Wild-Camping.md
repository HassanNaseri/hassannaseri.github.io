Despite the misleading title, this post is not about winter camping and survival in the cold. It is about wild camping in summer time, based on my camping experinece in northern edge of Europe. 

2020 has been a year for campers, despite being limitted to conutries or in some cases neighbouring countries.

I have been camping in Norway few times for long periods. This year we decided to camp for three weeks in northern Norway and in Lofiten islands in wild grounds.

A close friend asked me for a list of imporetant items that we packed, just to make sure that he does not forget anything crucial. Hence, I ended up writing long note that is posted here.


 Mr. Marian! 

It took a while to send you this list, but it was just completed now after an hour of writing! Most stuff changed and the list ended up becoming a story :D I know that you already ordered a tent, sleeping bags and etc. But some of these stuff are older notes, so you can ignore them if irrelevant :) You can also ignore them all and camp your own style and survive :D

Cheers
Hassan


======= Tent =======
I bought "Helsport Nordmarka 8–10 Camp" from XXL at discount. This is a budget version of "Helsport Varanger 8–10 Camp" with some negligible features lacking. The tent is quite big, but we like it very much. There is also Nordmarka 6 for a more manageable pack. These are only outer tents, you may need an inner tent (summer version) that may cost more than the outer shell, if you buy from Varanger series. I purchased a Rubens inner tent, which only takes 2/3 of the tent space, so we have some outer space inside tent. I bought it from outletcamping.com. I figured out some solution for installing it inside Nordmarkka. I also purchased a separate floor/groundsheet for the tent (winter version that has an opening in the middle).

Anyhow, I have a spare tent if you need. And I can still arrange with my friend Vandad who has our key to give it to you.

======= Sleeping =======
Fahimeh purchased andown sleeping bags from Bergfreunde.fi, and I bought from bike24.net. The models are these:
Marmot - Women's Angel Fire - Malachite / Deep Teal | Regular - 168 cm - Left Zip
Carinthia D 600C M Down Sleeping Bag - black - Zip: Left
We had to change sleeping bags, and in summary bike24 had a better customer service and delivery. After using the bags, we figured out that Carinthia is a better sleeping bag and warmer despite their ratings.

As you know, sleeping bags, especially down, are useless when compressed. The ground is not very cold here, but can be super cold in permafrost areas. We carry a light insulating carpet with us to cover the tent floor. We used to carry foam rolls, or light self-inflating mattresses with us. I think the best ones are professional air mattresses with proper insulation ratings, but a yoga mat can also work.

We also carry small compressable pillows. Fahimeh prefers the tiny memory foam pillow that we bought from Jysk.

======= Camping furniture! =======
We bought foldable chairs and a table. You don't necessary need them, but having a pair of chairs can significantly contribute to your magical sea-watching experience. 

We have a piece of tarp (cheap one from Biltema), and a light blanket to use on the ground for sitting or on the beach. A piece of tarp is also very useful as groundsheet for your tent in heavy rain. Just remember to tuck all the edges under your tent if you use it as groundsheet.


======= Water and Washing =======
At this spot there is a toilet but it has no water inside. There is a water tap here that you can wash your dishes, but the water is freezing cold. You need a pretty strong detergent. We have Fairy Extreme or something like that. It works to some extend in cold water but also takes a layer from your skin :D Campsites have warm water, and we washed our dishes once in a campsite. We may try that again. You need some sort of container/basket for washing dishes. We found those plastic storage boxes (30x40cm) very useful. Ideally you would need two of them for washing plenty of dishes!

You will go through plenty of drinking water. We took several water bottles and few 1.5 soda litre bottles, in total 10 litres. We fill them at cafes or campsites on route. I bough a 5 litre bottled water from a nearby store yesterday. We found a good spring nearby with fresh water flowing directly from snow and filled our bottles. There are springs everywhere.


I ordered a shower tent, but UPS created some delivery problems and I finally did not collect it, so it got returned. It was from Amazon.co.uk, and the model was WolfWise Camping Toilet Tent Pop Up Shower. I think it would be very useful in this trip as we are in an open beach area with no shower. We can of course wash ourself in the sea or with swimsuit on. Or make day trips to campsites as we did once during last week. 

I also ordered a portable foot pumped shower bucket/hose called DR.PREPARE Camp Shower, Portable from amazon.co.uk. We tested it at home, it was working very well. But we forgot it last minute at home :( This would be even more useful here as we could add some hot water to it and wash ourself freely. I can ask Vandad to take it from our place if you can arrange with him to take it with you. 

In addition we have a shower bag thingy called "Qdreclod Solar Camping Shower Bag, 40L Portable". It is bag with whose that you heat up in the sun or with hot water and hang from a tree for example. We use it now to wash Jasmin, and it works to some extent. We have no tree here to hang it from anyway. I also have a foldable bucket, to take/collect water. 

We took those tightly packed travel/camping towels with us, but anything else will work.

======= Cooking and Food =======
We carry two butane/propane stoves (from Biltema). The ones with a hose are much better than the ones that screw on top of the gas bottle. Alcohol stove is also fine, modern ones burn hot. You don't need those multi fuel burners unless you have one. I use a fire blanket (they are quite cheap) to setup stove inside the tent. Folding a 1mx1m fibreglass blanket twice creates a safe surface for cooking inside tent.

We have a set of aluminium camping dishes/pots. I also took a grilling pan, two kettles, and a flask. Bring at least two sets of utensils and couple of sharp knifes as you cannot wash them every time. We have two sets of cups as well. I think those wide aluminium cup/containers with foldable handle are vey useful. We don't have them, but they are perfect for eating soup, and versatile for other stuff. I bough a small steel tongs for bbq and cooking.

You can make fire everywhere in Norway! We made a campfire near our tent. We also bought charcoal, and those one time use grills. So you can buy and grill lamb chops for every meal.

Food can be purchased fresh from nearby stores. We took a car fridge with us, which is very good if you are on the road or in campsites (were you can plug into outlet), but pretty useless in wild setup. It works as storage, and you can buy ice from shops as well. Canned or dry stuff like soups, rice, pasta, beans, etc. can be carried anyhow. We only took food with us for couple of days and purchased on route what we need.

We have tea and tea bags for me, Nescafe for Fahimeh, and formula powder for Jasmin :D

I took my own spices with me including peppers, dried herbs, etc., a small bottle of olive oil, salt and sugar.

Bring some kitchen towels to use as table cloth on the floor, and also for drying dishes. 

======= Clothing =======
Most of the time I have heavy-duty hiking boots, a tough waterproof outdoor pant, and a tough insulated ski jacket on me. I wish I had two of these pants, as I did not wear anything else. Most people also have thick outdoor pants. I think hardware store pants can also work! A ski jacket with large hood works well, as it is windy here, otherwise bring some sort of a hat.

It is cold here, especially at night in areas near Finnish border. Other than sleeping bags, we wear a merino wool base layer and a fleece mid layer. I wish, I brought two sets of those base layers as I wear them every night. Anyhow, I highly recommend two sets of wars cosy clothing for sleeping and plenty of underwear as you may not be able to wash them.

Other than a waterproof boot, I also wear a pair of Converse sneakers when it is warmer. We have flip flops for the beach or shower. I also walk barefoot :D 

We also took light raincoat / outdoor jackets for not very cold times. We use them for wind or rain protection in warmer times. 

I have a fishing hat to protect from sun. Also took some short pants and t-shirts, but nit used them much. Long sleeve t-shirts are more useful.


======= Swimming in Jäämeri! =======
As strange as it sounds, people swim here. They don't have saunas but they invented another trick that involves running very fast from a distance towards the sea! Anyhow, bring your swimsuits. There are also some warmer spots on route. You may also bring swimming goggle. Actually, we need swimming goggles to discover my lost phone's carcass under the water :D Some people have their wetsuits, scuba diving gear, underwater harpoon shooting guns, surfing boards, etc. with them. There is a nearby beach to rent surfing stuff if you are into it.


======= Other Stuff =======
People live on fish here :D Everyone has a fishing rod. You may bring yours if you got any. Otherwise, I have two sets with me but did not catch anything yet.

No one sleeps here until well after midnight and some people are shouting until morning. If you are sensitive bring ear plugs!

I have duct tape, paracord, needle and thread, carabiner hooks, and some other stuff with me that found plenty of use so far. The most used item was a Leatherman multitool. I also have a big knife with minimal use so far, and a pull saw that found some use! 

Mosquitoes! Almost all of them moved from Norway to Finland at some point in history :D In the Norwegian side, we did not use any product for mosquitoes, and in the Finnish side nothing really works. Best protection is not to stop in Finnish Lapland :D We have that gas burning fuming device, it works to some extent, but does not still make the experience pleasant. Bring whatever repellent you find.

We have first-aid kit including band aids, tick removal thing, disinfecting pads, pain killers, etc. 

Soap for washing hands and maybe some for your cloth. In campsites there are washing machines but they may not have detergent. A small mirror for shaving, and any other toiletry that you may need.

Before Kilpisjärvi there is no gas station in a while. At border crossing they check IDs of all passengers. Have some ID with yourself.

There is a Biltema and many other shops in half-hour distance from our campsite, so eventually we can buy things that we need here as well.


We have most of the stuff you mentioned, but good advice about the clothing, I was thinking one layer for the night would be enough. The tent arrived yesterday, I pitched it to check all is ok and it took the entire living room 😀 It is 4+ persons. We have 2 sleeping bags for winter that we got from Tokmani for 30 eur each. They seem warm enough. We have two chairs, very basic, from xxl and 2 of this wind sofas as Finns call them. More like a big 200l bag filled with air that rolls at one end - probably you have seen these. They were pretty cheap at XXL also. With the burners, we ended up buying the one with a hose, as you said, from XXL. Initially we went for Biltema but they only had the ones that screw on top of the gas tank. I was arguing with them that the product is not as in the picture and on display before entering the store, but they simply raised their shoulders and said it is an old product. We spent more than am hour asking around and trying to find that product. Never again at Biltema 😀

Just couple of additional notes, the weather has been quite warm and sunny yesterday and today in Lofoten. People are in the beach and we are thinking to swim in the sea. There are beach volleyball grounds here, so you may bring a ball if u come here and wanna play! Actually there is sone pro training hoing on as well. I attached a photo! You may need some clips for drying cloths. Those springy paper clips are versatile for attaching other stuff as well. Those wind sofas sound good, some people have them here. I found a good fishing spot and catched a big fish yesterday. Will go there again! If you camp in Turku, lighter clothing should suffice.


It has been raining here from midnight. The ground is perfect for taking all the water, not a single drop flows! It seems to be sunny in next days, so we are still staying in Lofoten. It is fine to be inside for a day as we have a pretty big tent. Pitching on wet ground or even under rain is perfectly fine, but more cumbersome and maybe fun 🤪 Anyhow, we are not going to Tromso this weekend, because of bad weather. It was so hot here for last couple of days, that people slept naked after sun hit the beach. Hope you enjoy your archipelago adventure. But you will get wet.
